## Background:
TASKING Inspector products are modified TASKING C/C++ compiler. Inspector helps compiler users to evaluate if they might be impacted by a know issue of the compiler and to decided how to mitigate the issue.
Mitigation examples:
- Use a newer compiler version or latested patch
- Change command line option
- Rewriting source code
...

### How does work?
TASKING customer run the Inspector 'compiler' like the normal compiler from TASKING and get an enriched log output which shows the location (issue detected, filename, line, column).

## **il_conv** (**I**nspector **L**og **conv**erter)
A small tool to generate XLSX files (for Excel) enriched with all known issue information incl. direct links to latest information about each known issue on TASKINGs issue portal.

HTML output is prepared but design of the output is currently under evaluation and disabled in the new version.

## Example usage:
```
$ il_conv -?
...
$ il_conv -v -x issues_tasking_TCVX_v6.3r1.xml -r readme_tricore_v6.3r1_inspector_v1.0r6.html logfile.txt
```
## Features:
- [x] Command line tool
- [x] Can use all published information from TASKING issue portal (XML export to be done by user)
- [x] Use the latest information available for detection (from readme/release note of the respective Inspector)
- [x] Generate one XLSX workbook report with one cover sheet + 3 data sheets (compact, normal, extended) based on user feedback :-)
  - **compact:** File, Filepath (hidden), Issue ID, SIL, Fixed Compiler Version, Summary, Description (hidden), Mitigation (hidden), Lines, detection types (hidden)
  Note: multiple occurences of detection gets collapsed in one line (customer request)  
  - **normal:** File, Filepath (hidden), Issue ID, SIL, Fixed Compiler Version, Summary, Description (hidden), Mitigation (hidden), Line, Column, detection type (hidden) 
  - **extended:** same like normal but all visible beside detection type
- [x] Hover over Issue ID shows Mitigation if any
- [x] Remove superfluos output (duplicate impact locations) potentially generated by Inspector tool
- [x] Binary release possible (one file executable script) without own python installation
- [x] Click-through from XLSX Issue ID  

## Open
[ ] Allow click-through from HTML ~~and XLSX~~ to Ticket details

## Dependencies (pip -r requirements.txt)
- Python 3.10 or later
- openpyxl
- Pillow
- beautifulsoup4
  - lxml 
- ~~requests~~
- ~~numpy~~
- ~~datatable~~

In case you wanna build the scripts into a onefile executabe
- nuitka based - supported (see create_nuitka_exe.bat on windows)

Be aware that nuitka builds depends on a bunch of addtional things to be installed in addtion (e.g. gcc compiler) on the build machine
--> much easier is using the provided exe file from our release page

## Know bugs: 
- none :-)
  It's a pretty simple script, hack it yourself or create a nice feature / bug ticket for us and we might have a look :-d

Paul & Peter

  
Note: 
This script is as is, no notion of completeness or that it works under all circumstances ...
### We'll get not payed for that work it's just for fun, so please be polite.
