## Background:
TASKING Inspector products are modified TASKING C/C++ compiler to help their customers to evaluate if they might be impacted by a know issue of the compiler and to decided how they can mitigate the issue (e.g. use a newer version / patch of the compiler, rewriting their code, changing the used compiler settings etc....)

## How does work?
TASKING customer run the Inspector 'compiler' like the normal compiler from TASKING and get an enriched log output which shows the location (issue detected, filename, line, column).

## il_conv (**I**nspector **L**og **conv**erter)
A small tool to generate XLSX files (for Excel) enriched with all known issue information incl. direct links to latestest information about an known issue on TASKINGs issue portal.

HTML output is prepared but design of the output is currently under evaluation and disabled in the new version.

## Example usage:


il_conv -?
 ...

il_conv -x issue--output-format=html log.txt

il_conv -u login@companyname.com -p password --output-format=xlsx log.txt log2.txt ...


## Features:
* [x] Command line tool
* [x] Generation of xlsx output from parsed inspector tooling output, enriched with some issue portal data
* [-] readme_tricore_v6.3r1_inspector_v1.0r6.htmlGeneration of HTML output from parsed inspector tooling output, enriched with some issue portal data
* [x] HTML output styled by css stylesheet
* [x] Remove superfluos output (duplicate impact locations) generated by Inspector tool
* [x] Output in general configurable (hide/show columns, order, shortening source path)
* [x] Binary release possible (one file executable script) without own python installation

# Open
* [ ] Less hardcoding in table structure
* [ ] Allow more nicer names for the portal issues (hardcoded)
* [ ] Improve script design - not very well 
* [ ] Allow click-through from HTML and Excel to Ticket details
* [ ] Mid-Term - think about adding addition ticket details (currently only overview page of portal is parsed)

## Dependencies (pip -r requirements.txt)
- Python 3.10 or later
- openpyxl
- Pillow
- beautifulsoup4 (*pip install beautifulsoup4*)
-- lxml 
- ~~requests~~
- ~~numpy~~
- ~~datatable~~

In case you wanna build the scripts into a onefile executabe
* nuitka based - supported (see create_nuitka_exe.bat on windows)

Be aware that nuitka builds depends on a bunch of addtional things to be installed in addtion (e.g. gcc compiler) on the build machine
--> much easier is using the provided exe file from our release page

## Know bugs: 
* none :-)
  It's a pretty simple script, hack it yourself or create a nice feature / bug ticket for us and we might have a look :-d

## This script is as is, no notion of completeness or that it works under all circumstances ...
  
### We'll get not payed for that work it's just for fun, so please be polite.
